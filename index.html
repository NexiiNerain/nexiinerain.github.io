  <h1>Welcome! This is a WIP so don't expect much yet!</h1>
  <div class="basicDiv">
    <p>As you can probably tell, it's been far too long since I've done any HTML, so yeah, I'm rusty, but this site is intended to look right out of the 90s, including, eventually having all of the hyperlinks look like old popup ads! This site is meant to be my blog and also just a fun project to waste time, so have fun!</p>
