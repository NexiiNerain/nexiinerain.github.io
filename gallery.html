    <img src="assets/pictures/art/nexii1.png" align="right">
    <h2>Nexii</h2>
    <p>My favorite rendering of Nexii so far, done by the talented <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/umbreveon/">umbreveon</a> on FA! This is the SFW version, the NSFW version is not available on this site, nor my FA profile.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I strongly suggest trying <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/umbreveon/">umbreveon</a> if you need some art drawn up, he's a great artist and works decently fast, and on top of that, his commissions are extremely fairly priced!</p>
    <br><p></p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/nexii2.png" align="left" style="padding-right:12px;">
    <h2>Nexii Icon</h2>
    <p><a href=""></a>One of my favorite icons I own, second only to the one I got of Nexii and Vesereo together! An amazing piece by RixieCoyote on Telegram!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/nexves.png" align="right">
    <h2>Nexii and Vesereo Icon</h2>
    <p><a href=""></a>Another piece I commissioned from RixieCoyote, and this is easily my favorite profile picture to use. I usually use the transparent background version overlaid upon a trans pride flag or with no background at all.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/nexii4.png" align="left">
    <h2>Nexii by Devvv</h2>
    <p>This was my first commission from <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/devvv/">Devvv</a> on FA. He's easily one of my favorite artists, and a good friend of mine! I do strongly suggest commissioning him, especially if you have a dragon character you want some art of!</p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/devvv/">Devvv</a> specializes in inflation-related art, but he can also draw non-puffy things as well, such as this render of Nexii!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/nexii3.png" align="right">
    <h2>Goo Dragoness Nexii</h2>
    <p>This was a gift drawn by my close friend <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/retro5hole/">Retro5hole</a> on FA. Goo Dragoness Nexii is meant to be an alternate version of Nexii that is based loosely off of <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/oksara/">Oksara's</a> goo dragoness character.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This piece is one of my favorite full-body pieces that I have had drawn for me, <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/retro5hole/">Retro5hole</a> caught the drippy nature of goo perfectly in my eyes, and did amazing on th4e shadows! He doesn't do commissions yet, but I do suggest checking his FA, he does requests frequently too!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/nexii5.png" align="left">
    <h2>Anthro Kobold Pooltoy Nexii</h2>
    <p>This was another gift from <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/retro5hole/">Retro5hole</a>, this one is a pooltoy version of Nexii that we might end up using in a comic we started to write!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/novah1.png" align="right">
    <h2>Novah, The Wickerbeast</h2>
    <p>This was an adopt from <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/prison/">Prison</a> on FA. She is one of my lesser used OCs, but one of my favorites all the same!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/novah2.png" align="left">
    <h2>Novah, The Pooltoy Wickerbeast</h2>
    <p>This was a commission of Novah as a pooltoy playing with helium, commissioned from <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/rawr/">Rawr</a> from FA. This is one of two pieces I had commissioned of her by him.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/novahieaci.png" align="right">
    <h2>Novah and Ieaci</h2>
    <p>This is another piece by <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/rawr/">Rawr</a> from FA of Novah and Ieaci, an old character of mine that now belongs to <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/codeearth/">CodeEarth</a> on FA, who is a friend of mine. This was one of my favorite comms, and I still just love how Novah looks in it!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/novah3.jpg" align="left">
    <h2>Novah Headshot</h2>
    <p>This was a gift from my friend @друг Wodazabij on Telegram. She does a lot of spooky art, and her style is just 10/10 in my eyes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/novah.jpg" align="right">
    <h2>Novah Headshot 2</h2>
    <p>This was another gift from @друг Wodazabij on Telegram. Far less saturated, but if my memory serves me right, this was the first ever art other than the ref sheet of Novah that existed!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/komika1.png" align="left">
    <h2>Komika</h2>
    <p>Komika is another adopt from <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/prison/">Prison</a> on FA, this time a hybrid between a Wickerbeast and a Pacific Dolphin. She is yet another one of my favorite characters, and the added bonus of the relative rarety of hybrid Wickerbeasts just makes her that much more special!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/vesereo1.png" align="right">
      <h2>Vesereo</h2>
      <p>This is Vesereo (originally named Gravel but the artist,) A kobold I adopted from <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/astrotail/">Astrotail</a> on FA. In my lore, Vesereo is the mate of Nexii, and the two of them have all sorts of missadventures together.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/mara1.png" align="left">
    <h2>Mara</h2>
    <p>This is Mara, another one of my wickerbeasts I adopted a while ago, this one was designed by <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/jessiywolf/">JessiyWolf</a> on FA! I haven't done quite as much with her, but I have a few ideas of what to do for stories!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/unnamed1.png" align="right">
    <h2>Unnamed Wickerbeast</h2>
    <p>This is another adopt I got from <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/jessiywolf/">JessiyWolf</a> on FA, except this one I have not even named yet. They have an awesome horse-like pattern on their fur, which I just fell in love with!</p>

    <h2>Tea Mug Steam Animation</h2>
    <p>I did this to practice using Piskel, my pixel art drawing program on Ubuntu. I made the steam go too fast, but it was a good learning experience!</p>
