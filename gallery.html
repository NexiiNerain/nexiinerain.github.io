    <h2>Nexii</h2>
    <p>My favorite rendering of Nexii so far, done by the talented <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/umbreveon/">umbreveon</a> on FA! This is the SFW version, the NSFW version is not available on this site, nor my FA profile.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I strongly suggest trying <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/umbreveon/">umbreveon</a> if you need some art drawn up, he's a great artist and works decently fast, and on top of that, his commissions are extremely fairly priced!</p>
    <br><p></p>

    <h2>Nexii Icon</h2>
    <p><a href=""></a>One of my favorite icons I own, second only to the one I got of Nexii and Vesereo together! An amazing piece by RixieCoyote on Telegram!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/nexves.png" align="right">
    <h2>Nexii and Vesereo Icon</h2>
    <p><a href=""></a>Another piece I commissioned from RixieCoyote, and this is easily my favorite profile picture to use. I usually use the transparent background version overlaid upon a trans pride flag or with no background at all.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/nexii4.png" align="left">
    <h2>Nexii by Devvv</h2>
    <p>This was my first commission from <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/devvv/">Devvv</a> on FA. He's easily one of my favorite artists, and a good friend of mine! I do strongly suggest commissioning him, especially if you have a dragon character you want some art of!</p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/devvv/">Devvv</a> specializes in inflation-related art, but he can also draw non-puffy things as well, such as this render of Nexii!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="basicDiv">
    <img src="assets/pictures/art/nexii3.png" align="right">
    <h2>Goo Dragoness Nexii</h2>
    <p>This was a gift drawn by my close friend <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/retro5hole/">Retro5hole</a> on FA. Goo Dragoness Nexii is meant to be an alternate version of Nexii that is based loosely off of <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/oksara/">Oksara's</a> goo dragoness character.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This piece is one of my favorite full-body pieces that I have had drawn for me, <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/retro5hole/">Retro5hole</a> caught the drippy nature of goo perfectly in my eyes, and did amazing on th4e shadows! He doesn't do commissions yet, but I do suggest checking his FA, he does requests frequently too!</p>

    <h2>Anthro Kobold Pooltoy Nexii</h2>
    <p>This was another gift from <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/retro5hole/">Retro5hole</a>, this one is a pooltoy version of Nexii that we might end up using in a comic we started to write!</p>
